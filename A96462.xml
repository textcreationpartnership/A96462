            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If any ſhall now ask, the Why, this Narrative was not ſooner publiſhed as neerer to the times wherein the things were acted, he hath the reaſon for it, in the former lines; which will the more cleerly appear unto his apprehenſion, if he ſhall perpend, how much cruelty is requiſite to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Rebellion; And how great care is neceſſary in the ſupporters, to obviate and divert the ſmallest things that tend to the unblinding of the people. So that it needs will follow, that they muſt have accounted this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great obſtructions, to their ſales of his Majeſties Lands, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil not joyning with them in the ſecurity. And greater to the pulling down the Royal Pallaces, when their chapmen ſhould conceit the Devil would haunt them in their houſes, for building with ſo ill got materials; As no doubt but that he hath, ſo numerous and confident are the relations made of the ſame, though ſcarce any ſo totally remarkeable as this, (if it be not, that others have been more conceald) in regard of the ſtrange circumſtances, as long continuances, but eſpecially the number of the perſons together, to whom all things were ſo viſibly both ſeen and done, ſo that ſurely it exceeds any other; for the Devils thus manifeſting themſelves it appears evidently, that there are ſuch things as Devils, to perſecute the wicked in this world as in the next.</p>
            <p>Now if to theſe were added the diverſe reall Phantaſms ſeen at White-Hall in <hi>Cromwells</hi> time, which cauſed him to keep ſuch nightly guards in and about his bed-chamber, and yet ſo oft to change his Lodgings. If thoſe things done at <hi>Saint James,</hi> where the Devill ſo joal'd the Centinels
<pb facs="tcp:168997:3"/> againſt the ſides of the Queens Chappell doors: that ſome of them fell ſick upon it, and others not taking warning by it, kild one outright, whom they buried in the place; And all other ſuch dreadfull things, thoſe that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the Royal houſes have been affrighted with.</p>
            <p>And if to theſe were likewiſe added, a relation of all thoſe Regicides and their Abettors, the Devil hath entred into, as he did the <hi>Gadarenes</hi> ſwine <note place="margin">S.

That which hath been of this within theſe 12 laſt years in <hi>England</hi> (ſhould all of this nature our Chronicles do tell, with all the ſuperſtitious Monks have writ, be put together,) would make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er volume, and of more ſtrange occur ents.</p>
            <p>And now as to the Penman of this Narrative, know, that he was a Divine and at the time of thoſe things acted, which are here related, the Miniſter and School-maſter of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> a perſon learned and diſcreet, not by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed with factious humors, his name <hi>Widows,</hi> who each day put in writing what he heard from their mouthes (and ſuch things as they told to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them the night before) therein keeping to their own words; And never thinking that what he had writ, ſhould happen to be made publick, gave it no better dreſs to ſet it forth.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168997:5"/> and went under the ſervants bed, and did the like to them; thence it walkt into a withdrawing room, and there did the ſame to all who lodged there: Thus having welcomed them for more then two hours ſpace, it walked out as it came in, and ſhut the outer door again, but with a clap of ſome mightie force; theſe gueſts were in a ſweat all this while, but out of it falling into a ſleep again, it became morning firſt before they ſpake their minds, then would they have it to be a Dog, yet they deſcribed it more to the likeneſſe of a great Bear, ſo fell to the examining under the Beds, where finding only the Mats ſcracht, but the Bed-coards whole, and the quarter of Beef which lay on the floor untoucht, they entertained other thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 18. They were all awaked, as the night before, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they heard all the great clefts of the Kings Oak brought into the Preſence Chamber, and there thumpt down, and after roul about the room, they could hear their chairs and ſtools toſt from one ſide of the room unto the other; and then; as it were) altogether joſled: Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done an hour together, it walkt into the with-drawing room, where lodged the two Captains, the Secretary, and two ſervants; here ſtopt the thing a while, as if it did take breath, but raiſed a hideous one, then walkt into the Bed-chamber, where lay thoſe as before, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bed it went, where it did heave, and heave again, that now they in bed were put to catch hold upon Bed-poſts, and ſometimes one of the other, to prevent their being tumbled out upon the ground; then coming out as from under the bed, and taking hold upon the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, it would ſhake the whole bed, almoſt as if a cradle rocked: Thus having done here for half an hour, it went into the withdrawing room, where firſt it came and ſtood at the beds feet, and heaving up the beds feet flopt down again a while, until at laſt it heaved the feet ſo high that thoſe in bed thought to have been ſet upon their heads; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus for two hours entertained them, went out as in the night before, but with a great noiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 19. This night they awaked, not until the midſt of the night, they perceived the room to ſhake, with ſomething that walkt about the bed-chamber, which having done ſo a while, it walkt into a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing room, where it took up a Braſſe warming-pan, and returning with it into the bed-chamber, therein made ſo loud a noiſe, in theſe Captains own words, it was as loud and ſcurvie, as a ring of five untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168997:5"/> Bells rang backward, but the Captains, not to ſeem afraid, next day made mirth of what had paſt, and jeſted at the Devil in the pan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. Theſe Captains and their company, ſtill lodging as before, were wakened in this night with ſome things flying about the rooms, and out of one room into the other, as thrown with ſome great force: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hart</hi> being in a ſlumber, was taken by the ſhoulder and ſhaked until he did ſit up in his bed, thinking that it had been by one of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, when ſuddenly he was taken on the Pate with a Trencher, that it made him ſhrink down into the bed-clothes, and all of them in both rooms kept their heads at leaſt within their ſheets, ſo fiercely did three dozen of Trenchers fly about the rooms; yet Captain <hi>Hart</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured again to peep out to ſee what was the matter, and what it was that threw, but then the Trenchers came ſo faſt and neer about his ears, that he was fain quickly to couch again: In the morning they found all their Trenchers, Pots and Spits, upon and about their beds, and all ſuch things as were of common uſe ſcattered about the rooms; this night there was alſo in ſeveral parts of the room, and outer-rooms, ſuch noiſes of beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at door<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and on the Walls, as if that ſeveral Smiths had been at work; and yet our Captain ſhrunk not from their work, but went on in that and lodged as they had done before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. About midnight they heard great knocking at every door, after a while the doors flew open, and into the withdrawing room en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſomething, as of a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ty proportion, the figure of it they knew not how to deſcribe; this walkt a while about the room ſhaking the floor at every ſtep, then came it up cloſe to the bed ſide, where lay Captain <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Careleſſe;</hi> and after a little pauſe, as it were, The bed-cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both at ſides and feet were drawn up and down ſlowly, then faſter again for a quarter of an hour, then from end to end as faſt as imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can fancie the running of the rings, then ſhaked it the beds, as if the joints thereof had crackt; then, walkt the thing into the bed-chamber, &amp; ſo plaied with thoſe beds there: Then took up eight Peuter-diſhes, and bouled them about the room, and over the ſervants in the truckle beds; then ſometimes were the diſhes taken up &amp; thrown croſſe the high-beds and againſt the walls, and ſomuch batteted; but there were more diſhes wherein was meat in the ſame room, that werenot at all removed: Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, in the Preſence Chamber there was ſtranger noiſe of weightie things thrown down, and as they ſuppoſed, the clefts of the Kings Oak
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168997:6"/> did roul about the room, yet at the wonted hour went away, and left them to take reſt, ſuch as they could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 22. Hath miſt of being ſet down, the Officers imployed in their work farther off, came not that day to <hi>Woodſtock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 23. Thoſe that lodged in the withdrawing room, in the midſt of the night were awakened with the cracking of fire, as if it had been with thorns and ſparks of fire burning, whereupon they ſuppoſed that the bed chamber had taken fire, and liſtning to it farther, they heard their fellows in bed ſadly groan, which gave them to ſuppoſe they might be ſuffocated, wherefore they call'd upon their ſervants to make all poſſible haſt to help them, when the two ſervants were come in, they found all aſleep, and ſo brought back word, but that there were no bed clothes upon them, wherefore they were ſent back to cover them, and to ſtir up and mend the fire; when the ſervants had covered them, and were come to the Chimney, in the corners they found their wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparrel, boots, and ſtockings, but they had no ſooner toucht the Embers, when the firebrands flew about their ears ſo faſt, that away ran they into the other room, for the ſhelter of their cover-lids, then after them walkt ſomething that ſtampt about the room, as if it had been exceeding angry, and likewiſe threw about the Trenchers, Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all ſuch things in the room, after two hours went out, yet ſtampt again over their heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 24. They lodged all abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 25. This afternoon was come unto them Mr. <hi>Richard Crook</hi> the Lawyer, brother to Captain <hi>Crook,</hi> and now Deputy-Steward of the Mannor, unto Captain <hi>Parſons</hi> and Major <hi>Butler,</hi> who had put out Mr <hi>Hyans</hi> his Majeſties Officer: To entertain this new gueſt, the Commiſſioners cauſed a very great fire to be made, of neer the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney full of wood, of the Kings Oak, and he was lodged in the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing room with his brother, and his ſervant in the ſame room; about the midſt of the night a wonderful knocking was heard and into the room ſomething did ruſh, which coming to the chimney-ſide, daſht out the fire, as with the ſtamp of ſome prodigious foot, then threw down ſuch weighty ſtuffe, what ere it was (they took it to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the clefts and roots of the Kings Oak) cloſe by the bed-ſide, that the houſe and bed ſhook with it: Captain <hi>Cockain</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low aroſe, and took their ſwords to go unto the <hi>Crooks,</hi> the noiſe ceaſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168997:6"/> at their riſing, ſo that they came to the door and called the two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though fully awaked, and heard them call, were ſo amazed, that they made no anſwer untill Captain <hi>Cockaine</hi> had recovered the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to call very loud, and came unto their bed-ſide; then faintly firſt, after ſome more aſſurance, they came to underſtand one another, and comforted the Lawyer: whilſt this was thus, no noiſe was heard, which made them think the time was paſt of that nights troubles, ſo that after ſome little conference they applied themſelves to take ſome reſt, when Captain <hi>Cockaine</hi> was come to his own bed, which he had left open, he found it cloſely covered, which he much wondered at, but turning the clothes down, and opening it to get in, he found the lower ſheet ſtrewed over with trenchers, their whole three dozens of trenchers were orderly diſpoſed between his ſheets, which he and his fellow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to caſt out, ſuch noiſe aroſe about the room, that they were glad to get into bed with ſome of the trenchers: the noiſe laſted a full half hour after this; This entertainment ſo ill did like the Lawyer, and being not ſo well ſtudied in the point, as to reſolve this the Devils Law-caſe, that he next day reſolved to begone, but having not diſpatcht all that he came for, profit and perſwaſions prevailed with him to ſtay the other hearing, ſo that he lodged as he did the night before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 26. This night each room was better furniſhed with fire and candle then before; yet about twelve at night came ſomething in, that daſht all out, then did walk about the room; making a noiſe, not to be ſet forth by the compariſon with any other thing, ſome times came it to the bed-ſides, and drew the Curtains to and fro, then twerle them, then walk about again, and return to the bed-poſts, ſhake them with all the bed, ſo that they in bed were put to hold one upon the other, then walk about the room again, and come to the ſervants bed, and gnaw and the wainſcot head; and ſhake altogether in that room, at the time of this being in doing, they in the bed-chamber heard ſuch ſtrange dropping down from the roof of the room, that they ſuppoſed twas like the fall of mony by the ſound. Captain <hi>Cockaine</hi> not frighted with ſo ſmall a noiſe, (and lying near the chimney) ſtept out, and made ſhift to light a candle, by the light of which he perceived the room ſtrewed over with broken glaſs, green, and ſome as it were pieces of broken bottles, he had not long been conſidering what it was, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uddainly his candle was hit out, and glaſs flew about the room; that he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168997:7"/> made haſte to the protection of the Coverlets, the noiſe of thundering roſe more hideous then at any time before; yet at a certain time all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht into calmneſs. The morning after was the glaſs about the room, which the maid, that was to make clean the rooms ſwept up into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and many came to ſee it: But Mr. <hi>Richard Crooke</hi> would ſtay no longer, yet as he ſtopt going through <hi>Woodſtock</hi> Town, he was there heard to ſay, that he would not lodge amongſt them another night for a Fee of 500. <hi>l.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 27. The Commiſſioners had not yet done their work wherefore they muſt ſtay, and being all men of the ſword, they muſt not ſeem afraid to encounter with any thing though it be the Devill, therefore with piſtols charged, and drawn ſwords laied by their bed ſides, they applied themſelves to take ſome reſt, when ſomething in the midſt of night, ſo opened and ſhut the window caſements, with ſuch claps, that it awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened all that ſlept; ſome of them peeping out to look what was the matter with the windows, ſtones flew about the rooms as if hurled with many hands, ſome hit the walls, and ſome the beds heads cloſe above the pillows; the dints of which were then, and yet (it is conceived) are to be ſeen; thus ſometime throwing ſtones; and ſometime making thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering noiſe, for two hours ſpace it ceaſt, and all was quiet till the morn; after their riſing and the maid come in to make the fire they looked about the rooms: they found fourſcore ſtones brought in that night, and going to lay them together, in the corner where the glaſs (before mentioned) had been ſwept up, they found that every piece of glaſs had been carried away that night: many people came next day to ſee the ſtones, and all obſerved, that they were not of ſuch kind of ſtones as are naturall in the countrey thereabout, with theſe were noiſe like claps of thunder, or report of Cannon planted againſt the rooms; heard by all that lodged in the outer courts, to their aſtoniſhment, And at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> Town, taken to be thunder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 28. This night, both ſtrange and differing noiſe from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, firſt wakened Captain <hi>Hart</hi> who lodged in the bed chamber, who hearing <hi>Roe</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> to groan, called out to <hi>Cookaine</hi> and <hi>Cocka</hi> to come and help them, for <hi>Hart</hi> could not now ſtir himſelf; <hi>Cockaine</hi> would faine have anſwered, but he could not, or look about, ſomething he thought, ſtopt both his breath and held down his eye lids. Amazed thus he ſtruggles and kickt about, till he had awaked Captain <hi>Crook</hi> who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168997:7"/> half aſleep grew very angry at his kicks, and multiplied words it grew to an appointment in the field; but this fully recovered <hi>Cockaine</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Captain <hi>Hart</hi> had called for help, wherefore to them he ran in the other room, whom he found ſadly groaning: where ſcraping in the chimney he both found a candle and fire to light it; but had not gone two ſteps when ſomething blew the candle out, and threw him in the chair by the bed ſide, when preſently cried out Captain <hi>Careleſs,</hi> with a moſt pittiful voice, come hither, O come hither brother <hi>Cockaine,</hi> the things gone of me, <hi>Cockaine</hi> ſcarce yet himſelf; helpt to ſet him up in his bed, and after Captain <hi>Hart,</hi> and having ſcarce done that to them, and alſo to the other two they heard Captain <hi>Crook</hi> crying out, as if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been killing him; <hi>Cockaine</hi> ſnacht up the ſword, that lay by their bed and ran into the room to ſave <hi>Crook</hi> but was in much more likelyhood to kill him, for at his coming the thing that preſſed <hi>Crook</hi> went of him, at which <hi>Crook</hi> ſtarted out of his bed, whom <hi>Cockaine</hi> thought a ſpirit made at him, at which <hi>Crook</hi> cried out Lord help, Lord ſave me, <hi>Cockaine</hi> let fall his hand, and <hi>Crook</hi> embracing <hi>Cockaine</hi> deſired his reconcilement; giving him many thanks for his deliverance, then roſe they all and came together, diſcourſed ſometimes godly and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times praied, for all this while was there ſuch ſtamping over the roof of the houſe, as if 1000. horſe had there been trotting, this night all the ſtones brought in the night before, and laid up in the withdrawing room: were all carried again away by that which brought them in, which at the wonted time left of, and as it were went out, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 29. Their buſineſſe having now received ſo much forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as to be neer diſpatcht they encouraged one the other and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try further, therefore they provided more lights and fires, and further for their aſſiſtance prevailed with their Ordinary keeper; to lodge amongſt them and bring his Maſtive Bitch, and it was ſo this night with them, that they had no diſturbance at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob</hi> 30 So well they had paſt the night before, that this night they went to bed confident, and careleſſe untill about 12 of the clock; ſomething knockt at the door as with a ſmiths great hammer, but with ſuch force as if it had cleft the door: then entred ſomething like a Bear, but ſeem'd to ſwell more big and walkt about the room, and out of one room into the other; treading ſo heavily as the floare had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168997:8"/> not been ſtrong enough to bear it, when it came into the bed chamber it daſht againſt the beds heads ſome kind of glaſs veſſell, that broke in ſundry pieces, and ſometimes would take up thoſe pieces, and hutle them about the room, and into the other room; and when it did not hurle the glaſſe at their heads, it did ſtrike upon the tables as if many ſmiths with their greateſt hammers had been laying on as upon an anvill: ſometimes it thumpt againſt the walls, as if it would beat a hole through; then upon their heads ſuch ſtamping, as if the roof of the houſe were beating down upon their heads, and having done thus, during the ſpace (as was conjectured) of two hours, it ceaſed and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but with a more fierce ſhutting of the doors then at any time before; in the morning they found the pieces of glaſs about the room, and obſerved that it was much differing from that glaſſe, brought in three nights before, this being of a much thicker ſubſtance, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons which came in carried away ſome pieces of; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were in debate of lodging there no more, but all their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was not done, and ſome of them were ſo conceited as to believe, and to attribute the reſt they enjoyed the night before this laſt unto the Maſtive bitch; wherefore they reſolved to get more company, and the Maſtive bitch, and try another night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 31. This night the fires and lights prepared, the Ordinary keeper and his bitch, with another man perſwaded by him, they all took their beds and fell aſleep; But about 12 at night ſuch rapping was on all ſides of them that it wakened all of them, as the doors did ſeem to open; the Maſtive bitch fell fearfully a yelling, and preſently ran fiercely into the bed to them in the truckle bed; as the thing came by the table, it ſtruck ſo fierce a blow on that, as that it made the frame to crack, then took the warming-pan from off the table and ſtroke it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the walls with ſo much force as that it was beat flat together lid and bottom; now were they hit as they lay covered over head and care within the bed clothes; Captain <hi>Careleſs</hi> was taken a ſound blow on the head with the ſhoulder-blade bone of a dead Horſe, (before they had been but thrown at when they peept up and miſt,) <hi>Brown</hi> had a ſhrewd blow on the leg, with the backbone, and another on the head, and every one of them felt ſeverall blows of bones and ſtones through the bed clothes, for now theſe things were thrown as from an angry hand, that meant further miſchief: the ſtones flew in at window as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168997:8"/> ſhot out of a Gun, nor was the burſts leſſe (as from without) then of a Cannon, and all the windows broken down; now as the hurling of the things did ceaſe, and the thing walke up and down, Captain <hi>Cockaine</hi> and Hart cried out, <hi>In the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, What are you? what would you have? what have we done that you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb us thus?</hi> No voice replied (as the Captains ſaid, yet ſome of their ſervants have ſaid otherwiſe) and the noiſe ceaſt. Hereupon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Hart and <hi>Cockain</hi> roſe, who lay in the Bed-chamber, renewed the fire and lights, and one great candle in a candleſtick they placed in the door, that might be ſeen by them in both the rooms; no ſooner were they got to bed, but the noiſe aroſe on all ſides more loud and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous then at any time before, inſomuch (as to uſe the Captains own words) it returned and brought ſeven Devils worſe then it ſelf, and preſently they ſaw the candle and candleſtick in the paſſage of the door, daſht up to the roof of the room, by a kick of the hinder parts of a Horſe, and after with the Hoof trod out the ſnuffe, and ſo daſht out the Fire in the Chimnies; as this was done, there fell as from the ſieling, upon them in the Trucklebeds ſuch quantities of water, as if it had been poured out of Buckets, which ſtunk worſe then any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtink could make; And as this was in doing, ſomething crept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the High beds, toſt them up to the roof of the Houſe, with the Commiſſioners in them, until the Teſters of the beds were beaten down upon them, and the Bedſted-frames broke under them; and here ſome pauſe being made, they all as if with one conſent, ſtarted up, and ran down the ſtairs until they came into the Councel-Hall, where two ſate up a Brewing, but now were fallen aſleep, thoſe they ſcared much with wakening of them, having been much perplext before with the ſtrange noiſe, which commonly was taken by them abroad for thunder, ſometimes for rumbling wind; here the Captains and their company got fire and candle, and every one carrying ſomething of either, they returned into the Preſence-Chamber, where ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to make the fire, whilſt others fell to Prayers, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got ſome clothes about them, they ſpent the reſidue of the night in ſinging Pſalms and Prayers; During which, no noiſe was in that room, but moſt hideouſly round about, as at ſome diſtance.</p>
            <p>It ſhould have been told before, how that when Captain <hi>Hart</hi> firſt roſe this night, (who lay in the Bed-chamber next the fire) he found
<pb facs="tcp:168997:9"/> their Book of valuations croſſe the embers ſmoaking, which he ſnacht up and caſt upon the Table there, which the night before was left upon the Table in the preſence amongſt their other Papers: This Book was in the morning found a handful burnt, and had burnt the Table where it lay; <hi>Brown</hi> the Clerk ſaid, he would not for a 100 and a 100 <hi>l.</hi> that it had been burnt a handful further.</p>
            <p>This night it happened that there were ſix Cony-ſtealers, who were come with their Nets and Ferrets to the Cony-burrows by <hi>Roſamonds</hi> Well; but with the noiſe this night from the Mannor-houſe, they were ſo terrified that like men diſtracted away they ran, and left their Haies all ready pitched, ready up, and the Ferrets in the Cony-burrows.</p>
            <p>Now the Commiſſioners more ſenſible of their danger, conſidered more ſeriouſly of their ſafety; and agreed to go and confer with Mr. <hi>Hoffman,</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Wotton,</hi> (a man not of the meaneſt note for life or learning, by ſome eſteemed more high) to deſire his advice together with his company and prayers. Mr. <hi>Hoffman</hi> held it too high a point to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on ſuddenly and by himſelf, wherefore deſired time to conſider up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, which being agreed unto, he forthwith rode to Mr. <hi>Jenkinſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wheat,</hi> the two next Juſtices of Peace to try what Warrant they could give him for it. They both (as 'tis ſaid from themſelves) encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to be aſſiſting to the Commiſſioners, according to his calling.</p>
            <p>But certain it is, that when they came to fetch him to go with them, <note place="margin">By which is to be noted, that a Presbyterian Miniſter dares not encounter an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Devil.</note> Mr <hi>Hoffman</hi> anſwered, That he would not lodge there one night, for 500 <hi>l.</hi> and being askt to pray with them, he held up his hands and ſaid, That he would not meddle upon any terms.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hoffman</hi> refuſing to undertake the quarrel, the Commiſsioners held it not ſafe to lodge where they had been thus entertained any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but cauſed all things to be removed into the Chambers over the Gatehouſe, where they ſtaid but one night, and what reſt they enjoyed there, we have but an uncertain relation of, for they went away early the next morning; but if it may be held fit to ſet down what hath been delivered by the report of others, they were alſo the ſame night much affrighted with dreadful apparitions, but obſerving that theſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſpread much in diſcourſe, to be alſo in particulars taken notice of, and that the nature of it made not for their cauſe, they agreed to the concealing of things for the future; yet this is well known and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Gate-keepers wife was in ſo ſtrange an agony in her

            <p>From <hi>Woodſtock</hi> the Commiſſioners removed unto <hi>Euelme,</hi> and ſome of them returned to <hi>Woodſtock</hi> the Sunday ſennight after (the Book of <hi>Valvations</hi> wanting ſomething that was for haſte, left imperfect) but lodged not in any of thoſe rooms where they had lain before, and yet were not unviſited, (as they conſeſs themſelves) by the Devill whom they called their nightly gueſt, Captain <hi>Crook</hi> came not untill <hi>Tueſday</hi> night, and how he ſped that night the gate keepers wife can tell if ſhe dareth, but what ſhe hath whiſpered to her goſſips, ſhall not be made a part of this our Narrative, nor many more particulars which have fallen from the Commiſſioners themſelves and their ſervants to other perſons; they are all or moſt of them alive, and may add to it when they pleaſe, and ſurely have not a better way to be revenged of him who troubled them, then according to the Proverb, tell truth and ſhame the Devill.</p>
            <p>There remains this obſervation to be added, that on a Wedneſday morning all theſe Officers went away; And that ſince them diverſe perſons of ſeverall qualities, have lodged often and ſometimes long in the ſame rooms, both in the preſence with drawing room and bed chamber, belonging unto his Sacred Majeſty yet none have had the leaſt diſturbance, or heard the ſmalleſt noiſe for which the cauſe was not as Ordinary as apparent; except the Commiſſioners and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who came in Order to the alienating and pulling down the houſe, which is well nigh performd.</p>

                  </gap>odſtock</hi> is one of the ancient honours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Crown. Severall Mannors owe ſuite and ſervice to the place; But the cuſtom of the Countrey giving it, but the title of a Mannor we ſhall erre with them to be the better underſtood.</p>
            <p>The Mannor Houſe, hath been a large Fabrick, and accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Majeſties ſtanding houſes, becauſe there was alwaies kept a ſtanding furniture; This great houſe was built by King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, but amplyfied with the gate houſe and out ſides of the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, the ſtables by King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About a bow ſhoot from the gate Southweſt, remain foundation ſigns of that ſtructure erected by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, for the ſecurity of Lady <hi>Roſamond,</hi> daughter of <hi>Walter</hi> Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> which ſome Poets have compared to the <hi>Dedalian Labyrinth,</hi> but the form and circuit both of the place &amp; ruins, ſhew it to have been a houſe &amp; of one pile; perhaps of ſtrength according to the faſhion of thoſe times, and probably was fitted with ſecret places of receſs and avenews to hide or convey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch perſons as wete not willing to be found if narrowly ſought after. About the midſt of the place ariſeth a ſpring called at preſent <hi>Roſamonds</hi> Well; It is but ſhallow and ſhews to have been pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and walled about likely contrived for the uſe of them within the houſe, when it ſhould be of danger to go out.</p>
            <p>A quarter of a mile diſtant from the King houſe, is ſeated <hi>Woodſtock</hi> Town new and old: This new <hi>Woodſtock</hi> did ariſe by ſome buildings which <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond gave leave to be erected, (as received by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) at the ſuite of the Lady <hi>Roſamond,</hi> for the uſe of out ſervants upon the waſtes of the Mannor of <hi>Bladon</hi> where is the Mother Church, this is a Hamlet belonging to it, though encreaſed to a market Town by the advantage of the Court reſiding ſometime near, which of late years they have been ſenſible of the want of; this Town was made a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in the 11. year of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, by Charter with power to ſend two Burgeſſes to <hi>Parliament</hi> or not, as they will themſelves.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Woodſtock</hi> is ſcated on the Weſtſide of the brook named <hi>Glyme</hi> which alſo runneth through the Park, the Town conſiſts not of above four or five houſes, but it is to be conceived, that it hath been much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168997:10"/> larger, (but very anciently ſo) for in ſome old Law Hiſtorians there is mention of the Aſſiſe at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> for a Law made in a <hi>Micelgemote</hi> (the name of Parliaments before the coming of the <hi>Norman)</hi> in the days of King <hi>Etheldred.</hi> And in like manner that thereabout was a Kings Houſe, if not in the ſame place where <hi>Hen.</hi> the firſt built the late ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pile before his; for in ſuch days thoſe great Councels were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held in the Kings Pallaces. Some of thoſe Lands have belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Orders of the Knights Templers there being Records which call them, <hi>Terras quas Rex excambiavit cum Templariis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now this late large Mannor Houſe is in a manner almoſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heaps of Rubbiſh: Some ſeven or eight rooms left for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of a Tenant that ſhould rent the Kings medows, (of thoſe who had no power to let them) with ſeveral high uncovered Walls ſtanding, the prodigious Spectacles of malice unto Monarchy, which ruines ſtill bear ſemblance of their State, and yet aſpire in ſpight of envy, or of weather, to ſhew, <hi>What Kings do build, Subjects may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhake, but utterly can never overthrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That part of the Park called the High-Park hath been lately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided by Sir <hi>Arthur Haſelrig</hi> to make paſtures for his breed of Colts, and other parts plowed up. Of the whole ſaith <hi>Roffus Warwicenſis in Ms. Hen.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 122. <hi>Fecit iſte Rex Parcum de Woodſtock, cum Palatio infra praedictum Parcum qui Parcus erat primus Parcus Angliae &amp; continet in circuitu ſeptem Miliaria, conſtructus erat Anno</hi> 14. <hi>bujus Regis, aut parum poſt.</hi> Without the Park the Kings Demeſn Woods were, it cannot well be ſaid now are, The Timber being all ſold off, and underwoods ſo cropt and ſpoiled by that Beaſt the Lord <hi>Munſon</hi> and other greedy Cattel, that they are hardly recoverable: Beyond which lieth <hi>Stone-field</hi> and other Mannors that hold of <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> with other Woods, that have been aliened by former Kings, but with reſervation of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for his Majeſties Deer, and other beaſts of Forreſt to harbour in at pleaſure, as in due place is to be ſhewed.</p>
